-- OBJECTIVE 2: IDENTIFY WHICH VEHICLES ARE STOLEN

-- 1. Find the vehicle types that are most often and least often stolen.

SELECT * FROM stolen_vehicles;

SELECT vehicle_type, COUNT(vehicle_id) AS num_vehicles
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY num_vehicles DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT vehicle_type, COUNT(vehicle_id) AS num_vehicles
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY num_vehicles
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. For each vehicle type, find the average age of the cars that are stolen.

SELECT vehicle_type, AVG(YEAR(date_stolen) - model_year) AS avg_age
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY avg_age DESC;

-- 3. For each vehicle type, find the percent of vehicles stolen that are luxury versus standard.

SELECT * FROM stolen_vehicles;
SELECT * FROM make_details;

WITH lux_standard AS (SELECT vehicle_type, CASE WHEN make_type = 'Luxury' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS luxury, 1 AS all_cars
FROM   stolen_vehicles sv LEFT JOIN make_details md
	   ON sv.make_id = md.make_id)
       
SELECT vehicle_type, SUM(luxury) / COUNT(luxury) * 100 AS pct_lux -- you can also replace SUM(all_cars) --> COUNT(luxury)
FROM lux_standard
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY pct_lux DESC;

-- 4. Create a table where the rows represent the top 10 vehicle types, the columns represent the top 7 vehicle colors (plus 1 column for all other colors) and the values are the number of vehicles stolen.
SELECT * FROM stolen_vehicles;

'Silver','1272'
'White','934'
'Black','589'
'Blue','512'
'Red','390'
'Grey','378'
'Green','224'
'Other'

SELECT color, COUNT(vehicle_id) AS num_vehicles
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY color
ORDER BY num_vehicles DESC;

SELECT vehicle_type, COUNT(vehicle_id) AS num_vehicles,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Silver' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS silver,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'White' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS white,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Black' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS black,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Blue' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS blue,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Red' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS red,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Grey' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS grey,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color = 'Green' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS green,
       SUM(CASE WHEN color IN ('Gold', 'Brown', 'Yellow', 'Orange', 'Purple', 'Cream', 'Pink') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS other
FROM stolen_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_type
ORDER BY num_vehicles DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 5. Data visualization: Create a heat map.
